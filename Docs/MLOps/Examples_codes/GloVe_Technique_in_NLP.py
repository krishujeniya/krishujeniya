To use pre-trained word embeddings like GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) in NLP, we need to follow these steps:

1. Download and load pre-trained word embeddings (GloVe in this case).

2. Prepare a sample text for which we'll obtain word embeddings.
3. Tokenize the text and convert words to their corresponding pre-trained word embeddings.
4. Output the word embeddings for the sample text.

Please note that without a dataset, we won't be able to demonstrate the full potential of pre-trained word embeddings on real-world data, but we can still show you how to load and use them on a sample text.

First, you need to download the pre-trained GloVe word embeddings. You can find them on the Stanford NLP website: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

Make sure you download the appropriate GloVe vectors (e.g., GloVe with 100, 200, or 300 dimensions).

Next, let's implement the code:

'''
import numpy as np
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Load pre-trained GloVe word embeddings
def load_glove_embeddings(file_path):
    embeddings_index = {}
    with open(file_path, encoding='utf-8') as f:
        for line in f:
            values = line.split()
            word = values[0]
            embedding = np.array(values[1:])
            embeddings_index[word] = embedding
    return embeddings_index

# Prepare a sample text
sample_text = "I love natural language processing."

# Load GloVe embeddings (replace 'glove.6B.100d.txt' with the path to your downloaded GloVe file)
glove_embeddings = load_glove_embeddings('glove.6B.100d.txt')

# Tokenize the sample text and get the word embeddings
tokenized_text = word_tokenize(sample_text.lower())
word_embeddings = [glove_embeddings.get(word, np.zeros(100)) for word in tokenized_text]

# Output word embeddings for the sample text
print("Sample Text:", sample_text)
for word, embedding in zip(tokenized_text, word_embeddings):
    print(f"{word}: {embedding}")
'''

Explanation of the code:

1. We define the `load_glove_embeddings` function to load the pre-trained GloVe word embeddings from the downloaded file. The function reads the file line by line and stores the word as the key and the embedding vector as the value in a dictionary (`embeddings_index`).

2. We prepare a sample text that we want to analyze. In this case, the sample text is "I love natural language processing."

3. We load the pre-trained GloVe embeddings using the `load_glove_embeddings` function. Replace `'glove.6B.100d.txt'` with the path to the GloVe file you downloaded.

4. The sample text is tokenized using the NLTK library's `word_tokenize` function, and each token (word) is converted to its corresponding pre-trained word embedding (if available). If the word is not found in the embeddings, a zero vector is used as a placeholder.

5. Finally, we output the word embeddings for each word in the sample text.

Please make sure you have NLTK installed. If you don't have it, you can install it using `pip install nltk`.

Keep in mind that with a small sample text like this, the embeddings may not be very informative. In real-world NLP tasks, you would use pre-trained word embeddings on large datasets to capture richer word representations, which can then be used for various NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and more.
